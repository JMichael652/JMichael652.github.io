		<p>In the Positive Pychology book <i>The Happiness Hypothesis</i>, author Jonathan Haidt makes frequent reference to Christian Scriptures (among other religious works) to give context for some of his points. These references, naturally, are more helpful to a reader familiar with the <i>Holy Bible</i>, and by extension the stories from which the quotes are pulled. To help alleviate this divide in contextual understanding, all of the Biblical references in <i>The Happiness Hypothesis</i> have been listed below (by chapter) along with the surrounding text in the Haidt's book as well as the surrounding text from the Biblical context from which the reference is pulled. To assist the more curious reader, a link is also provided to an online version of the entire <i>Bible</i> chapter.</p>
		<aside>All Biblical passages listed here, from both <i>The Happiness Hypothesis</i> and the <i>Holy Bible</i>, are pulled from the New Revised Standard Version, a 1989 full English Biblical translation.</aside>

				<div class="hh-quote"><p class="reference">page 81</p><p>If money or power could buy happiness, then the author of the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes should have been overjoyed. The text attributes itself to a king in Jerusalem, who looks back on his life and his search for happiness and fulfillment. He tried at one point to “make a test of pleasure,” by seeking happiness in his riches:<br><br><span class="exact-quote">I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself; I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees &hellip; I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and delights of the flesh, and many concubines. So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me. Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.</span> (ECCLESIASTES 2:4-10)<br><br>But in what may be one of the earliest reports of a midlife crisis, the author finds it all pointless:<br><br><span class="exact-quote">Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and again, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</span> (ECCLESIASTES 2:11)<br><br>The author tells us about many other avenues he pursued—hard work, learning, wine—but nothing brought satisfaction; nothing could banish the feeling that his life had no more intrinsic worth or purpose than that of an animal. From the perspective of Buddha and the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, the author’s problem is obvious: his pursuit of happiness.</p></div>
				<div class="bible-quote"><p class="reference">Ecclesiastes 2:1-15</p><p>1 I said to myself, “Come now, I will make a test of pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But again, this also was vanity. 2 I said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?” 3 I searched with my mind how to cheer my body with wine — my mind still guiding me with wisdom — and how to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was good for mortals to do under heaven during the few days of their life.4 <span class="exact-quote">I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself; 5 I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.</span> 6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees. 7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house; <span class="exact-quote">I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. 8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I got singers, both men and women, and delights of the flesh, and many concubines.<br><br>9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me. 10 Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. 11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had spent in doing it, and again, all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</span><br><br>12 So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the one do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done. 13 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.<br><br>14 The wise have eyes in their head, but fools walk in darkness.<br><br>Yet I perceived that the same fate befalls all of them. 15 Then I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will happen to me also; why then have I been so very wise?” And I said to myself that this also is vanity.</p><p class="chapter-link">(full chapter: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/ECC.2.NRSV" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 2</a>)</p></div>

				<div class="hh-quote"><p class="reference">page 114</p><p>Bowlby’s theory directly contradicted Watson as well as the Freuds (Sigmund and Anna): If you want your children to grow up to be healthy and independent, you should hold them, hug them, cuddle them, and love them. Give them a secure base and they will explore and then conquer the world on their own. The power of love over fear was well expressed in the New Testament: <span class="exact-quote">“There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear”</span> (I JOHN 4:18).</p></div>
				<div class="bible-quote"><p class="reference">I John 4:16-21</p><p>16 So we have known and believe the love that God has for us.<br><br>God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. 17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 <span class="exact-quote">There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear</span>; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 Those who say, “I love God,” and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen. 21 The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.</p><p class="chapter-link">(full chapter: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/1JN.4.NRSV" target="_blank">I John 4</a>)</p></div>

				<div class="hh-quote"><p class="reference">page 119</p><p>Between the ages of eight and fourteen, safe haven expands from parents to include peers as adolescents begin turning to each other for emotional support But it’s only at the end of adolescence, around the ages fifteen to seventeen, that all four components of attachment can be satisfied by a peer, specifically a romantic partner. The New Testament records this normal transference of attachment: <span class="exact-quote">“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh”</span> (MARK 10:7-9).</p></div>
				<div class="bible-quote"><p class="reference">Mark 10:2-9</p><p>2 Some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” 3 He answered them, “What did Moses command you?” 4 They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of dismissal and to divorce her.” 5 But Jesus said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment for you. 6 But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ 7 <span class="exact-quote">‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, 8 and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> 9 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</p><p class="chapter-link">(full chapter: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/MRK.10.NRSV" target="_blank">Mark 10</a>)</p></div>

			<div class="quote-pair">
				<div class="hh-quote"><p class="reference">page 130</p><p>Christianity brought forward many of these classical fears of love. Jesus commands his followers to love God, using the same words as Moses (<span class="exact-quote">“With all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might,”</span> MATTHEW, 22:37, in referring to DEUTERONOMY 6:5). Jesus’ second commandment is to love one another: <span class="exact-quote">“You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</span> (MATTHEW 22:39). But what can it mean to love others as one loves oneself? The psychological origins of love are in attachment to parents and sexual partners. We do not attach to ourselves; we do not seek security and fulfillment in ourselves. What Jesus seems to mean is that we should value others as much as we value ourselves; we should be kind and generous even to strangers and even to our enemies. This uplifting message is relevant to the issues of reciprocity and hypocrisy that I talked about in chapters 3 and 4, but it has little to do with the psychological systems I have been covering in this chapter. Rather, Christian love has focused on two key words: caritas and agape. Caritas (the origin of our word “charity”) is a kind of intense benevolence and good will; agape is a Greek word that refers to a kind of selfless, spiritual love with no sexuality, no clinging to a particular other person. (Of course, Christianity endorses the love of a man and a woman within marriage, but even this love is idealized as <span class="exact-quote">the love of Christ for his church</span> — EPHESIANS 5:25) As in Plato, Christian love is love stripped of its essential particularity, its focus on a specific other person. Love is remodeled into a general attitude toward a much larger, even infinite, class of objects.</p></div>

It took Greg three days just to find out that they had not died in a car crash; Amy had taken the children and run off with a man she had met in a shopping mall a few weeks earlier.

And they are not just confabulating a silver lining to wrap around a dark cloud; people who have suffered through battle, rape, concentration camps, or traumatic personal losses often seem to be inoculated 7 against future stress: They recover more quickly, in part because they know they can cope.

I perceived that this also is but a chasing after wind.<br><br>18 For in much wisdom is much vexation,<br>and those who increase knowledge increase sorrow.</p><p class="chapter-link">(full chapter: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/2016/ECC.1.NRSV" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 1</a>)</p></div>
