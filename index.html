	</form>
	<br><br><br>
	Literally all that says in the HTML is
	<br><br>
	<span id="text"></span>
	<br><br><br>
	which is marginally more difficult than I thought, but still super easy.  Even easier is making
	<br><br>
	<a href="http://createfoundation.com/make-a-donation/make-a-donation-form/?selectfund=OXFORD%20HIGH%20SCHOOL%20THEATRE%20ARTS%20GUILD">Donate</a>
	<br>
	where all you have to do is type
	<span id="text2"></span>
	
	
	<script>
		document.getElementById("text").textContent="<form action=\"http://createfoundation.com/make-a-donation/make-a-donation-form/?selectfund=OXFORD%20HIGH%20SCHOOL%20THEATRE%20ARTS%20GUILD\">\n\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Donate\" />\n</form>";
